# CODSFOT - Here is the repository for my internship tasks given by CODSOFT. Here is the summary of each code task provided:
- BASIC CALCULATOR - This Python script defines a basic calculator program that allows users to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The `basic_calculator()` function handles the core functionality of the calculator, prompting users to input two numbers and then offering them a choice of operations. It ensures error handling by checking for division by zero when performing division. The `main()` function controls the program flow, repeatedly invoking the calculator function until the user decides to exit. It prompts the user after each calculation to determine whether they want to perform another one. This script provides a straightforward and interactive tool for performing common arithmetic calculations, making it useful for quick mathematical tasks.
- CONTACT MANAGEMENT - This Python code is designed to manage a contact list database using MySQL. It includes functions to set up the database and tables, add contacts, view the contact list, search for contacts, update contact information, and delete contacts. The main menu lets users choose between setting up the database, tables, contact management, and exiting the program. The contact management menu provides further options for adding, viewing, searching, updating, and deleting contacts. Each function interacts with the MySQL database to perform the respective operations. The code ensures that the database and tables are created if they do not exist and prompts the user for input when adding or updating contact details. The search function allows users to find contacts based on partial information, and the update function provides specific options for changing a contact's name, phone number, email, or address. The delete function removes a contact from the database based on the contact ID provided by the user. The program is structured to be user-friendly and interactive, providing a simple interface for managing contacts.
- PASSWORD GENERATOR - The code is a Python script designed to generate random passwords based on user input. It includes a function `generate_password(length)` that constructs a password by randomly selecting characters from different sets: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The user determines the length of the password. The script prompts the user to enter the desired password length and then generates a password according to that length. After displaying the generated password, the script asks the user if they want to generate another password. If the user answers "yes" or "y", the process repeats. If the user answers "no" or "n", the script exits. This interactive loop allows users to generate multiple passwords as needed.
- ROCK PAPER SCISSOR - The provided Python code is an interactive game allowing users to play Rock, Paper, and Scissors against a computer. The game starts with a welcome message and a menu prompting the user to select the game they wish to play. Once the user chooses to play Rock, Paper, and Scissors, they are asked to input their choice by typing 'r', 'p', or 's' for rock, paper, and scissors, respectively. The computer then randomly selects its move. The game compares the user's choice with the computer's and determines the outcome: a win, loss, or tie. The user's and computer's scores are tracked and displayed after each round. The game offers the option to play again after each round, and the total scores are accumulated until the user decides to stop playing. The code is structured with a `main()` function that controls the flow of the game, prompting the user for input and managing the overall gameplay. The `play_rock_paper_scissors()` function contains the logic for a single game round, including input validation, random computer choice, and scoring. The program uses a loop to allow for continuous play, and it exits when the user indicates they do not wish to play again.
- TO-DO LIST - The code is a To-Do List application that uses a MySQL database to store and manage tasks. It includes functions to set up the database and tables, add tasks, delete tasks, update task details, and display task information. The application is menu-driven, allowing users to select from a range of operations. Users can input tasks with an ID, name, start date, deadline, progress, and status. The code includes validation for date inputs to ensure they are in the correct format. The application's main menu offers options for database and table setup, while the task menu provides choices for task management. The program is designed to be interactive, guiding the user through the process of managing their tasks.
# Thanks a lot CODSOFT for providing this opportunity to showcase my Python skills. I hope that my coding skills meet your expectations.
